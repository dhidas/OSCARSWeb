<p>
OSCARS is a modern code for the computation of radiative properties of charged particles in electromagnetic fields.  OSCARS is capable of calculating spectra, flux, and power densities for arbitrary field configurations, multi-particle and mixed-particle beams, with user configurable precision.  Notably, OSCARS is capable of calculating flux and power density on arbitrary shaped surfaces in 3-D.
